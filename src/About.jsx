        Aruka Repair is a small, family-owned automobile repair shop. We provide
        quality, affordable repairs to the people of our community. We
        understand that not everyone can afford to have their car towed to the
        dealer and have it repaired for an exorbitant price, so we offer honest,
        reliable repairs at a fraction of the cost. We work on all makes and
        models of cars, and we are always here to help our customers get back on
        the road safely and quickly.
